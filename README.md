# restaurant_page

Project from TheOdinProject

The Restaurant Page project focused on generating the entire content of the website using JavaScript alone.

Tools used included JSON and Webpack.

I learned a lot about using separate source and distribution files to organize the code in this project. Importing and exporting fuctions helped make this possible and taught me how useful and effective this can be.
